The gospel of the<br>
water and the<br>
Spirit washed<br>
away all my sins<br><br></h4></p>
<p>
I testified to the gospel of the water
and the Spirit as it is revealed in the
Bible in my first book, “Have you truly
been born again of water and the
Spirit?” This book is a sort of a sequel
to the first one, and I have tried to
delve deeper into the truth of being
born again in the way God intended.<br><br>
By comparing the gospel of the
water and the Spirit to the false gospel
that is popular these days, I have tried
to help increase your understanding of
the true gospel. Above all, I have tried
to help you see how the existing
theology has plunged many people into
fallacy and caused them to lose sight of
the true gospel.<br><br>
Now let us all return to the amazing
blessed word of the gospel of the water
and the Spirit that God has given us.</p>

<p>THANKS<br>
I thank the Lord for allowing us to preach the gospel of the
water and the Spirit through the Church of God in this age of
darkness. I am sure that the Lord blesses us as we preach the
gospel of the water and the Spirit to all the souls in this world
through this book, so that they may all be born again.
I also thank the Lord for giving us workers and the ability to
carry out the work of God. I would like to express my sincere
appreciation to Mrs. Jungpil Sul for translating, to Ross Wallace
for proofreading, to sister Sangmin Lee for editing, and to Rev.
John K. Shin. I would like to express heartfelt thanks to all the
other workers of the gospel who helped in the publication of this
book.
This book, a sequel to my first book, reveals more clearly the
gospel of the water and the Spirit and the origin and the reality
of the false gospel. I hope and pray that it will help lead you
back to the true gospel of the water and the Spirit.
I pray to God that all souls in this world may come to believe
in the gospel of the water and the Spirit and be born again, so
that the will of God may be done in this world. I thank the Lord
again. 
